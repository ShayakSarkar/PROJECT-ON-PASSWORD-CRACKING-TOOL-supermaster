Every password transformation shall be done on the basis of a rule.

Rules:
	Character Transforms -- {CT}
	String Transforms    -- {ST}
	Special Transforms   -- {SpT}
		
	General Syntax:

		For a Transform:
			<Transform Type><target_char/target_string>=<new_string1,new string2,new string3...>
			Ex: {CT}c=[,C,<;
			    {ST}pass=&4$$,ls;
			
			The first rule will cause generation of all possible passwords with 'c' replaced by "[","C","<"
			For example 
				Main Password is "cat": 
				Generated Passwords: "[at","Cat","<at"

			Similaly Strings shall be replaced with the corresponding required strings
